  utter_faq/cancel_edit_order:
    - text: "You can cancel your order while it's still in a Processing status. Once the status changes to Shipped, the order can't be canceled. Once a cancellation request is submitted, it can't be undone.\n If the order or item is too far along to cancel, most items can be returned. Learn more about our return policy or start a return in your account once you receive the item.\nUse these steps to see if the item or order is still in a Processing status and request a cancellation.\n1. In the upper-right corner of any Walmart.com page, click the Account icon.\n2. Select Track Order.\n3. Enter the email address used to place the order and the order number shown on your order confirmation email.\n4. Click Cancel next to the item you wish to attempt to cancel.\nIf you do not see a Cancel button, it could be because your order is too far along to cancel. If your order is being fulfilled by a Marketplace Seller, you can select Cancel if it's available or you can reach out to the seller using the Contact Seller button."

  utter_faq/order_location:
    - text: "You can track your order from your shipping confirmation email or by visiting Walmart.com. We send an email with a tracking link as soon as your package ships, which you can use any time to check its progress.\nTo track order on Walmart app:\n1. Go to Walmart.com\n2. Select the avatar icon in the upper-right corner\n3. Select Track Orders\n4. If you're not logged in or are tracking a guest order, enter the email address you used to submit your order and your order number. If you are already logged in to your Walmart.com account, this link routes you to your Purchase History page, where you can scroll to the order to track it."

  utter_faq/get_refund:
    - text: "If you return your item to a Walmart store or by mail, you should see the money appear on your original payment method in up to 10 business days (depending on your financial institution).\nIf you return an item you purchased with a Walmart Gift Card or eGift Card, you should see the refund appear within 3 hours on the gift card you used. Be sure to hang on to your gift card until you are sure you want to keep everything you bought with it.\nIf you bought an item on Walmart.com that you paid for in-store, only a Walmart store can provide your refund, but don't worry! You don't have to go back to the exact store where you paid for your order. Go to any customer service counter to collect your refund or request a check by mail.\nIf we have to cancel an order or item, we'll email you right away to ask how you prefer to get your money back. Learn more about canceled orders and items or contact Customer Care using the button below if you still have questions."
